ABSTRACT
Sonia Bisi Pajaujis
Fran\oise and Her Language in
Ala echerche du temps perdu
Florida Atlantic University
Master of Arts
1985
Each character in La Recherche du temps perdu speaks a
distinct idiolect. Only the language of Fransoise has
complex characterological and symbolic functions.
Fransoise's language serves three consistent purposes:
First, it represents the speech of the peasantry or a whole
social class. Second, as exclusively spoken French, it
embodies the long rich history of the French language since
the Middle Ages, constituting indeed a living palimpsest of
the language. Third, as palimpsest, it verbally situates
the character Fransoise as creative counterpart to the
narrating artist Marcel. Fransoise is the French language
through history: she is the "g~nie linguistique ~ l',tat
vivant."
INTRODUCTION
Proust's A la Recherche du temps perdu is awash in
speech, in a way that is surely unique in the history of the
novel. It is not only through their behavior, gestures, and
garments that Proust reveals his characters, but also
through their language. Especially in vocabulary, verbal
mannerisms, accent, and even intonation, Proust conveys the
essence of character, disclosing the most secret parts of
individual personalities. As the narrator Marcel remarks:
Comme un geometre qui, de'pouillant les choses de
leurs qualites sensibles, ne voit que leur
substratum lin6aire, ce que racontaient les gens
m'echappait, car ce qui m'interessait, c'~tait non
ce qu'ils voulaient dire, mais la maniere dont ils
le disaient, en tant qu'elle ~tait rev6latrice de
leur caract~re ou de leurs ridicules; ou plutSt
c'~tait un objet qui avait toujours / /
ete plus
particuli~rement le but de rna recherche •
(TR 41) l
Not only does spoken language express the most secret
interiority, but also each character in La Recherche speaks
his or her own language or, in modern linguistic
terminology, idiolect.2 Without using the modern term,
1 
2
however, Marcel himself emphasizes this idea of linguistic
individuality in the characters of the novel when upon
occasion he finds himself listening to their chorus of
voices:
Alors, je me rappelai d'autres voix encore, des
voix de femmes surtout ••. je me rappelai une a:
une la voix de chacune des jeunes filles que
j'avais connues a Balbec, puis de Gilberte, puis
de rna grand-mere, puis de Mme de Guermantes; je
les trouvai toutes dissemblables, moulees sur un
.... langage particulier a chacune. (LP 119)
Characters are thus differentiated by means of their
language. Such characterological techniques may suggest
that Proust was in the Balzacian fashion creating a series
of social types, the snobs, the adulteresses, the
dilettantes, and so on. But it is primarily language in
typification, expressive as it is of difference and
complexity rather than similarity. Even as, near the end of
the novel, social distinctions begin to blur, as a
bourgeoise becomes indeed a duchesse and dresses
accordingly, ideolect remains the only reliable index to
social origins and, Proust would have us believe, true
ethical character.
A search of the relevant literature has revealed that
to this date very little consideration has been given to an 
3
extensive analysis of idiolects and especially the language
of Fran~oise. Virtually all studies concerning language in
Proust either deal with his own general concept of language,
or, in a few critical articles and chapters concerning the
language of Proust's characters, enumerate the differences
among them.
Stephen Ullmann, for instance, documents the diversity
and intensity of Proust's linguistic interests in his
letters, citing, for example, Proust's emphasis on speech as
indicative of character. In his study H..u.mor in the Nor ks·
of Proust, Slater briefly discusses Proust's use of humor in
speech, taking as examples the language of Bloch, Charlus,
and Mme de Guermantes, among others. Le Bidois's article
"Le langage parle des personnages de Proust" suggests that
Proust has created a series of linguistic "case studies"
through his characters, in brief comments on the Guermantes,
Albertine, Charlus, Fran~oise, and other characters; and
outlines the Proustian laws of spoken language, that is,
Marcel's remark that speech manifests mental category, not
caste. Jean Mouton summarizes many of the same observations
and reaches similar conclusions, again essentially
extrapolating Marcel's ideas of language and applying them
to certain other characters. Other Proust scholars,
however, while not overtly dealing with language, contribute
significant perspectives on the subject. Tadie, most
notably, explicates very well the gestures, tones of voice, 
4
and the silences that are in my view part of speaking or
Proustian idiolect. 
REPRESENTATIVE IDIOLECTS
Representative idiolects in La Recherche include those
of the Guermantes, Charlus, Norpois, Bloch, and Mme
Verdurin. Initially the Duchesse de Guermantes, aloof and
unapproachable, is the subject of all Marcel's dreams,
inspired solely by the name Guermantes. From a distance,
the Duchesse is abstract, and an idealized product of his
imagination. The clash between reality and his projection
is brought about mainly through language, which creates the
first disenchantment in the disparity it reveals between the
person and the name:
/ , / [P]our que je n'eusse pas ete degu par les paroles
que j'entendrais prononcer a une personne qui
s'appelait Mme de Guermantes, ~ . . meme s1 Je ne
l'eusse pas . / a1mee, il n'eut pas suffi que les
paroles fussent fines, belles et profondes, il eut "
/ fallu qu'elles refletassent cette couleur amarante
de la derniere syllabe de son nom •.. (CG I 250-
1)
This first contact with the idiolect of the Duchesse
effectively creates a wedge between the person and the
reveries which had crystallized around the name.
Nevertheless this separation does not deprive her language
5 
6
of all its charm. Marcel is startled to discover in Mme de
Guermantes' speech a similar evocation of history that he
finds in the language of Fransoise, the former recalling
aristocratic history and the latter popular history. The
Duchesse's idiolect recalls historical states of the
language itself, as the narrator suggests:
Mme de Guermantes exprimait a la fois la plus
ancienne France aristocratique, puis ••• la fagon
dont la duchesse de Broglie aurait pu gouter et
blamer Victor Hugo sous la monarchie de Juillet,
enfin un vif gofit de la litterature issue de
Merimee et de Meilhac. ( CG II 2 44)
The Duchesse is "un vrai musee d'histoire de France par la
conversation" (LP 39). The Duchesse's archaic expressions
include, foi example, "des cravates a la Saint-Joseph," "des
enfantes vou~s au bleu," expressions that she shares with
the aristocracy in general (CG II 315). Her attachment to
outmoded forms of expression and the excellence of her own
language both explain and justify her amusement at the
expressions used by Saint-Loup:
Ces conversations aristocratiques avaient du
reste, chez Mme de Guermantes, le charme de se
tenir dans un excellent frangais. A cause de cela
elles rendaient l~gitime, de la part de la
duchesse, son hilar i te devant les mots 'vatique',
'cosmique', 'phythique', 'sureminent', 
7
qu'employait Saint-Loup • • • (CG II 316)
The Duchesse shares certain phonetic peculiarities with
Fransoise, pronouncing, as Mouton documents, "su sa robe"
for "sur sa robe" in following one of the rules of "le
fransais populaire," which makes "r" disappear at the end of
certain words ("pauvre," for example, becomes "pauv"; 188).
In wanting to mark the purity of her family's French
origins, she pronounces her parent's name Fitz-James as
"Pitt-Jam" (LP 39, Mouton 188), and at times even the tone
of her voice reflects a certain "rudesse de terroir" (CG II
242). What I wish to suggest is that, unlike the popular
French of Fransoise, the Duchesse's peasant locutions or
"c8te terrien" is consciously cultivated: she announces at
one point, with false deprecation, "je suis ~ b~te, je
parle comme une paysanne" (italics added, LP 48). The
highest aristocrat in France, she employs such peasant
"tournures" to maintain the fa5ade of unassuming simplicity.
In Le Temps retrouve, the social position of the Duchesse
begins to decline, and with this decline comes a distinct
reduction in the number of such remarks. As Marcel
comments, now "Elle avait toujours peur de donner un
avantage centre elle par ses paroles, de dire quelque chose
qui la diminuat" (TR 397); but she cannot wholly lose this
habit.
Another important aspect of her speech is what Marcel
terms "l'esprit Guermantes." For the Guermantes "esprit" 
8
has almost the status of a moral quality; the Duchesse
epitomizes more than anyon~ else this kind of wit. Her
verbal wit is displayed as frequently as her other
"accessoires de parades," in fact to a greater extent than
anywhere else in A le Recherche du temps perdu to her words
become objects, which are admired or rejected like any other
physical or moral attribute which the individual presents in
society. As Proust constructs it then, the Duchesse's
idiolect is an idiosyncratic amalgam of peasant simplicity
and aristocratic wit, thus revealing her lack of moral
center.
The Due de Guermantes appears to be less intelligent
and cultured than his wife, and in fact the narrator
discerns this in even his verbal insensitivity, "son
incapacite d'assimiler exactement les tours de la langue
fransaise" (SG 145). Perhaps therefore, his own language is
stereotypical and caricatural. Basin even uses cliches out
of context, such as "que voulez-vous que je vous dise?" (CG
I 282), to which there is comically no possible reply. The
Due provides a continuous negative contrast to all the
positive aspects of his wife's speech. Of the Duchesse, the
narrator says, "J'e'coutais sa conversation comme une chanson
populaire delicieusement fransaise" (LP 37). The archaisms
of the Due, on the other hand, give him a "genre jabot de
dentelles et deliquescent" (CG II 231). The difference
between the Duchesse's archaisms and the Due's seems to be 
9
that for the former they are partly an affectation; but her
archaisms are consistent with the natural savor of her
idiolect, and they ultimately show her esthetic sensitivity
to language. The Due's archaisms on the other hand seem to
mock the authentic historical origins of the French
language, and they reflect nothing but posturing: his
archaisms are intended to add to the image which he seeks to
project, but in no way do they indicate any awareness of. the
quality of language itself. Thus the Due says to . the
narrator, "Permettez-moi de vous d'barrasser de vos
frusques," the reason for such usage being that "il trouvait
a la fois bon enfant et comique de parler le langage du
peuple" (CG II 143). Basin terms the bishop of Maco n
"Monsieur de Mascon," "parce que le due trouvait cela
vieille France" (CG II 222).
The difference between the Due and the Duchesse is
perhaps best summarized in the contrasting images with which
the narrator describes their language. If the Duchesse's
language makes him think of a "musee d'histoire de France"
(LP 39), that of the Due is compared to an "ancienne demeure
de'pourvue de chefs-d'oeuvre veritables, mais pleine de
tableaux authentiques, mediocres et majestueux" (CG II 296).
Charlus's language is surely one of the most eclectic
in La Recherche. The best description of his language
occurs in a phrase uttered by the Duchesse: "Quel
cachottier , , que ce Meme" (CG II 95). As the Duchesse 
10
suggests, his language hints at madness, and the sheer
frenzy of his idiolect is at times reminiscent of Balzac,
where words are linked by association in overwhelming
accumulation, as in Balzac's description of the pension
Vauquer: "Pour expliquer combien ce mobilier est vieux,
, ~
crevasse, pourri, tremblant, ronge, manchot, borgne,
invalide, expirant, il faudrait en faire une description qui
retarderait trop l'int~r~t de cette histoire •.• " (11-2).
Charlus often uses this notorious "cumulation balzacienne,"
as in his references to Bloch's family and to Jews in
general. Charlus calls Bloch's mother "un vieux chameaux";
later he speaks of "l'afflux de messieurs et de dames du
Chameau, de la Chamellerie, de la Chamelliere ••• " (CG I
348). That Proust intends the association with Balzac is
clear from several tirades in which Charlus proclaims the
Comedie Humaine his favorite work.
But the most striking trait of Charlus's language is
the unwitting process of increasing self-revelation through
linguistic or paralinguistic means. Le Bidois has mentioned
that Charlus's voice (201), for example, is one of the keys
to the mystery of his true nature, offering an anticipatory
indication of the truth of his homosexuality revealed in the
final volumes. Tadie earlier pointed this out, observing
that, in the words of Tadi~, "Proust wants to find in the
voices of his characters the true self that is concealed in
it" (137). Proleptic in this way, the musical imagery 
11
frequently used to describe the Baron's tone is remarkably
exact, when for instance it reminds the narrator of "le duo
alterne d'un jeune homme et d'une jeune femme" (JFF 408).
However, I should like to add that Charlus's vocabulary
/ could also be called a "duo alterne" between correct, even
elevated language and extremes of vulgarity and slang. This
aspect of Charlus's language is seen notably early in his
relationship with the narrator. After the Baron's lofty
tone and words, and his distant manner, the sudden vulgar
familiarity of "Mais on s'en fiche bien de sa vieille grandm~re hein? petite fripouille!" (JFF 412) is a startling
contrast, betraying a tragic split in Charlus himself.
Charlus's volcanic temperament errupts in violent
language, which provides an emotional release for him. In
every crisis of violence to which the narrator is witness,
Charlus's tirade follows a similar pattern: his syntax
remains controlled but his vocabulary is not in accord with
it, and the pitch of his voice increases with hysteria:
Ah! re'pondit-il d'un air me'prisant Il faut
d'ailleurs que vous ayez des yeux pour ne pas
voir, puisque ce chef-d'oeuvre-la, vous m'avez dit
que vous aviez passe deux heures devant. Je vois
que vous ne vous y connaissez pas mieux en fleurs
qu'en styles; ne protestez pas pour les styles,
cria-t-il d'un ton de rage suraigu, vous ne savez
A ' meme pas sur quoi vous vous asseyez, vous offrez a 
12
votre derriere une chauffeuse Directoire pour une
bergere Louis XIV. Un de ces jours vous prendrez
les genoux de Mme de Villeparisis pour le lavabo,
et on ne sait pas ce que vous y ferez.
320)
(CG I I
With the release provided by words, Charlus returns to
relative calm. It is clearly a linguistic analogue of
sexual release in orgasm, or the very erotic activity that
he is trying to conceal in baronial speech. In another
instance Charlus's sexuality is appeased merely through
words: "Il y avait, en effet, certains etres qu'il lui
suffisait de faire venir chez lui, de tenir pendant quelques
heures sous la domination de sa parole, pour que son desire,
allume dans quelque rencontre fut apaise" (SG 38). In
Charlus's existence, language serves a purpose closely tied
to the fact of his homosexuality but it is also, as for Mme
Verdurin, a weapon to be used to threaten, convince, or
impress. On the whole Charlus dominates by sheer volume of
language which reflects, through verbal extravagance, his
fulsome personality and conceals moral depravity.
Although Norpois and Bloch seem like characterological
opposites, they are both empty social poseurs and thus
resemble each other linguistically. Moreover their presence
makes itself felt in the novel entirely through language.
With Norpois even more than with Bloch, Proust has
concentrated on a purely linguistic portrait: Norpois is 
13
"un repertoire si complet des formes surannees du langage
particulieres a une carri~re, a une classe et a un temps"
(JFF 16). Norpois's language is essentially that of the
diplomat; ambiguous, vague, avoiding open statement, and
comprehensible in many instances only to those whose
linguistic code functions in the same way. His language is,
as the narrator says, a collection of forms, static in
nature because of the lack of originality in his
"expressions toutes faites" such as "tirer son epingle du
jeu," "p~cher en eau trouble." Norpois's language, thus,
/ reveals him to be an empty man, a linguistic attache-case,
mere fasade without true individuality.
Le Bidois has noted that Bloch's spoken language is a
concoction of vulgarity, pretentiousness, and superfluous
ornamentation (208-9). He frequently makes frivolous
allusions to classical literature and mythology, reflecting
his pretentiousness. He promises the narrator that he will
find in the works of Bergotte "les joies nectar~ennes de
l'Olympos" (DCS 110), and swears friendship to Saint-Loup
"par le KroniSn Zeus, gardien des serments" (JFF 386). It
is also important to observe that in Bloch's language the
narrator finds indications of the secret anxieties of his
friend, a social outsider secretly ambitious. Bloch
mispronounces certain English words: "lift" as "lalft," and
"Venice" as "Vena"ice." Bloch's reaction to being caught in
these minor errors is to bristle that "Cel~ n'a d'ailleurs 
14
aucune espece d'importance" (JFF 380). He repeats this
defense verbatim when during the matin~e of Mme de
Villeparisis he clumsily overturns a vase filled with water
(CG I 258), and in both cases his extreme embarrassment
reflects the importance he attaches to facts and events that
his mocking words ostensibly belittle. Like Norpois's, his
language is a highly wrought facade.
Shrill, high-handed, domineering Mme Verdurin intends
through her language to influence the thought and actions of
her little group of followers. Her authoritarian
personality is manifested in several peculiarities of
speech. Her tone is frequently one of "despotisme
minaudier" (JFF 101). More obvious perhaps is her frequen t
use of the emphatic "moi." Such turns of phrase as "si vous
croyez que je m'amuse, moi" (DCS 242), "moi, il m'assommait"
(SG 418), and "~ moi, elle me l'aurait dit" (DCS 267)
indicate Mme Verdurin's tendency to place herself and her
views at the center of events. Hewitt has mentioned that
she seeks to dramatize herself as a creature of extreme
sensibility, with an especially rare esthetic sense (35). I
should like to add, however, that her only terms of
re~erence are physical and so betray her inimitable
vulgarity: "Ah! non non, pas rna sonate! je n'ai pas
envie a force de pleurer de me fiche un rhume de cerveau
avec n~vralgies faciales, comme la derni~re fois" (DCS 243-
4). Like many other members of Proust's world, Mme Verdurin 
15
evolves with the passage of time, and her vulgar language
also achieves some modification. As she marries into the
Guermantes family, one of the most peculiar ironies of A-la
Recherche du temps perdu is the fact that she is thereby
allied with all those whom for so long she had defensively
categorized as "les ennuyeux." Such a radical social change
has its effect on her language, and, the number of
"ennuyeux" progressively diminishing, the term itself
disappears from her speech. A new element acquired in this
linguistic evolution is Mme Verdurin's delight in using
vocabulary from the war. "Caviarder" and "limoger" (TR 59)
are typical examples of war terms used by many characters to
indicate that they are "~ la mode," as is even the vulgar
Verdurin in the social chaos of the age.
All the idiolects in La Recherche function as little
indices to character. Mme Verdurin tries to speak as a high
society woman but her vulgarity transpires in her speech.
Charlus who tries to hide his homosexuality is revealed
through his idiolect. Norpois's formulaic and vague
language shows him to be a true verbal balloon. Moreover
all the characters' idiolects are contrived, epitomes of
artifice and fasade, whereas Frangoise's idiolect is the
only one in the whole novel to be completely spontaneous. 
FRANSOISE'S IDIOLECT
Fransoise's language, however, is also unique because
of its much greater complexity and its general literary as
well as specifically characterological function. Concerning
Fransoise as a character, many readers have recognized that
she is a major figure in the nove1. 3 The very name
Fransoise suggests France, centuries of history and
tradition, and as Hewitt notes, Frangoise is moreover as
unchanging and mysteriously significant as the statue of a
saint in a medieval church: "C'etait Fransoise, immobile et
debout dans l'encadrement de la petite porte du corridor
comme une statue de sainte dans sa niche" (DCS 67); or an
illustration of Anne de Bretagne in a book of hours (JFF
272, Graham 50). 4 Through such associations, Fransoise
indeed represents the persistent force of the medieval past.
Only Fowlie has noted that "her speech is timeless for
Marcel; in it he hears locutions and proverbs that go far
back into the history of France" (243). It has not been
noticed that in La Prisonniere Fransoise can never say what
time it is nor can she even bear to look at a clock, and
this stubborn dissociation from clocks may suggest that she
is timeless. Indeed she often seems more like time itself
than a character affected by it. Her conduct is ruled by an
16 
17
antique code at least as ancient as that of the early books
of the Old Testament (DCS), and Marcel himself thinks at one
point that it is illustrated in the bas-relief of the church
of Saint-Andre-des-Champs (LP 16). This code is
intransigent but subtle, and resembles:
[C) es lois antiques qui, a cote' de prescriptions
~ ' feroces comme de massacrer les enfants a la
mamelle, defendent avec une delicatesse exageree
de faire bouillir le chevreau dans le lait de sa
m~re, ou de manger dans un animal le nerf de la
cuisse. (DCS 40)
Although she belongs to the domestic circle, she is
really unclassifiable because by dint of living in Marcel's
family, Frangoise is soon incorporated into it, even living
"en symbiose" with the family (CG I 21). Marcel's apartment
in Paris ~ , decore par les paroles de Fransoise
inspirees d'un sentiment traditionnel et local et qui
obeissaient ~des r~gles tr~s anciennes" (CG I 76). Since
she has been for so long a part of his daily life, Marcel at
the end of the novel imagines Fran~oise helping him with the
more routine tasks an artist faces in writing a novel.
Although she is by then old and going blind, she would make
sure his notes and the pages of his manuscript were kept in
some kind of order. He recalls, too, as Hewitt remarks,
that Fransoise has been an artist in her own right,
preparing culinary masterpieces with meticulous care and the
/ 
18
true artist's intuition for ingredients in their just
proportion (84). He wonders if he cannot learn from her as
well as from Vinteuil, Bergotte, and Elstir (LP 132). On
the whole, in my view, Frangoise is a mixture of immense
symbolic qualities, historical values, national tradition,
natural artistry, and national name. Noting her unswerving
fidelity to her master, Marcel feels she incarnates "un
passe fransais tres ancien, noble" (DCS 40). But she is
also distinctly human. I should like to emphasize that
La Recherche is a vast edifice in architectonics of duality.
Anything important in the novel is going to be dual, and so
is Fransoise. She is the solid French peasant, loyal and
hardworking, but her personality is split, because she ca n
be cruel and hypocritical or loyal and kind. Selfless as a
saint toward the family, she is often cruel or hypocritical
"paysanne" toward her inferiors, as when she goes through
the motions of sympathy for a pregnant servant-girl but is
privately vicious toward her. Whenever Fransoise is kind it
is more her moral character that is stressed, Frangoise the
old woman, rather than her social position, Fransoise the
maid.
Graham has observed that Fransoise has certain
qualities shared by animals or lower order of life:
faithful, not very bright, hard working, with the strength
of "la bete" (49). She works like a horse (DCS 69) and her
eyes when looking at her masters are like those of a good 
19
dog (JFF 272). When she is old, she is like an ancient,
half-blind eagle (LP 442). Like animals or primitive
peoples, she acts by instinct, and her knowledge is
sometimes quite astounding when she immediately percieves
the truth, as the narrator himself remarks:
[C]omme les hommes primitif dont les sens etaient
plus puissants que les notres, " elle discernait
immediatement, a des signes insaisissables pour
, . ., . . nous, toute ver1te que nous voul1ons lu1 cacher.
(DCS 41)
Her refined cruelty toward the "fille de cuisine" is as
physiologically sure as the method used by the burrowing
wasp to paralyze but not kill the prey for its hatching
larvae (DCS 148). From her long association with the
narrator's family, Frangoise arrives at the point where she
has for them "cette sorte de connaissance instinctive et
presque divinatoire qu'a de lamer le matelot, du chasseur
le gibier, et de la maladie, sinon le medecin, du moins
souvent le malade" (CG II 68) •
On the whole Fransoise is a vital force in the life of
Marcel as an artist, and she represents the better part of
himself, especially as intuitive "intelligence du coeur."
She plays an important role in the ultimate Proustian
consciousness of the final pages because she represents and
recalls tradition, nature, and especially "natural" speech,
all that is acquired yet remains spontaneous, organically 
20
formed and nurtured through long generations of French
history.
Although Marcel does not realize rt as a child when he
first meets her, Frangoise and her language are the most
solid human pillars that Marcel ever encounters in his long
wanderings in La Recherche. And it is to her that he turns,
in a highly significant way that cannot be stressed enough,
when once revelation occurs he projects before him, through
imagination, the prospectus of his work as an artist. For
he has long known that all Fransoise's knowledge is purely
instinctive; thoughts and ideas are not part of her mental
baggage. She is incapable of knowing anything, "sauf les
r a r e S V e r i t e S q U e 1 e C 0 e U r e S ·t C a P a b 1 e d I at t e i n d r e
directement" (JFF 272). In spite of these ostensible
limitations, and in contradistinction to all the other
characters, Frangoise in her ignorance, in her purely
instinctual intelligence, and in her language encoding the
past of France, achieves "la vraie vie" in her life, as in
art only Marcel as artist can achieve. She acts as Marcel's
living metaphor of involuntary memory. She is the living
expression of France itself, the vital past in the present.
Fran5oise's language in A la Recherche du temps pe-rdu
seems to serve three major functions. It represents the
speech of the peasantry or a whole social class. As
exclusively spoken French, it embodies the long history of
the French language since the Middle Ages as well as its 
21
oral survival in the modern countryside with "le peuple."
Finally and symbolically it verbally situates the character
Frangoise as creative counterpart to the narrating artist
Marcel.
Although this is not a linguistic study but an
examination of Fran5oise's language as a literary component
of Marcel's novel, the language of a fictional character
certainly manifests such linguistic elements as grammatical
errors or syntactical errors. I should like to stress at
this point, however, that the following remarks on
linguistic aspects of her language are subordinate to larger
symbolic concerns, and that the context here is purely
literary. 5
Initially young Marcel is far from realizing the
broader significance of Fransoise's speech, and considers
her language primarily a collection of errors:
Si alors Fran5oise, remplie comme un po~te d'un
flat de pensees confuses sur le chagrin, sur les
souvenirs de famille, s'excusait de ne pas savoir
repondre ~ mes theories et disait: 'Je ne sais
pas m'exprimer', je triomphais de cet aveu avec un
bon sens ironique et brutal •.• et si elle
ajoutait: 'Elle etait tout de m@me de la
parentese, ' il reste toujours le respect qu'on doit
ala parent~se,' je haussais les epaules et je me
disais: 'Je suis bien bon de discuter avec une 
22
illettree qui fait des cuirs pareils.' (DCS 182)
In the same volume, Marcel expresses a great sense of
contempt for Frangoise's idiolect:
Fransoise me criait: 'Allons, aboutonnez voir
votre paletot et filons' et que je remarquais pour
la premiere fois avec irritation qu'elle avait un
langage vulgaire • (DCS 458)
To simplify the analysis of a complex evolution, two epochs
can be distinguished in Fran5oise's language. Initially, in
~ ~ - the early sections of Du Cote de chez Swann, she very often
speaks the patois of her rural origins. We never hear this
patois, which the narrator never quotes; he thus
deliberately prevents us from identifying it linguistically,
stressing instead its two characterological functions,
namely Marcel's frustration at not understanding it and
Fransoise's delight in having a secret language
unintelligible to "educated" people. On the other hand,
concerning standard French, her regional, popular, and
archaic French is full of barbarisms; it is, however, so
flavorsome that its na'ivete and its implicit traditionalism
excite at times the narrator's admiration. Much later,
Marcel himself hearing it spoken so frequently learns
Frangoise's patois (LP 183). But consequently Frangoise
stops speaking that language which she earlier considered a
secret medium of communication, and uses only French. At
the same time her French is increasingly corrupted by the 
23
Parisian slang of her daughter, who comes to Paris and has
adopted the linguistic habits of the lower popular classes
in the capita l , and whose influence is soon present in
Fransoise's own use of such terms as "se cavaler, and
presto," "Je vais me cavaler, et presto," (LP 182), and
"patatipatali et patatipatala" (TR 79).
remarks:
The narrator
Ainsi perdent leur purete toutes les langues par
l'adjonction de termes nouveaux. Cette decadence
du parler de Frangoise, que j'avais connu ~ ses
belles epoques •.• (LP 182) .
The contaminated language of the ma!tre d'hetel also has a
contagious effect on the speech of Fransoise; she is
affected by his pronunciation of "pissotieres," and,
although she knows the correct pronunciation, she adopts
"pissetiires" as a friendly compromise (TR 79). Marcel
explains:
Enfin elle ne parlait plus bien comme autrefois.
Car dans son humilite, dans sa tendre admiration
pour des ~tres qui lui etaient infiniment
inferieurs, elle adoptait leur vilain tour de
langage. (TR 78)
From Marcel, Frangoise borrows certain nouns, rearranging
them as "jouer la pantomine," and sometimes entire
sentences: "[L]a maison est empestee depuis que la
gentillesse a installe ici la fourber ie, que 1' intelligence 
24
protege la plus bete qu'on ait jamais vue ••• " (LP 116).
Gerard Genette sees in this change of Fransoise's
idiolect the most palpable evidence of the general
degradation, which includes virtually everything in the last
parts of La Recherche (227). These evolutionary aspects of
Fransoise's language show also, in my view, that her speech
is a still living palimpsest of linguistic strata which goes
from the Middle Ages to modern usages. She encompasses it
all because Fransoise is symbolically the French language
itself: "Son langage, comme la langue fransaise elle-meme •
" (CG I 26), see discussion below). Moreover, because
the language is not fixed in time and space (a rare and
valuable state in La Recherche), Fransoise's idiolect thus
changes also, absorbing the languages that she hears around
her.
Aside from the evolutionary changes in her language, it
is characterized by a number of constant factors. Among
these constants are the various categories of error typical
of an individual lacking any formal education. Frangoise
does not understand any abstract notions but only "les rares
verit~s que le coeur est capable d'atteindre directement"
(JFF 272). However, her native intelligence allows her to
be "plus essentiellement apparente[e] aux natures d'elite
que ne le sont la plupart des gens instruits" (JFF 272).
Therefore Fransoise's intelligence is unique because,
although she cannot comprehend abstract ideas, she possesses 
25
that quality that most educated people lack: the direct and
spontaneous comprehension of reality.
In his complex relationship with Fransoise, the young
Marcel is not above occasionally reminding her of her
linguistic deficiencies. But Marcel learns that Fran5oise's
errors reflect the stumbling history of the French language,
as palimpsest, and that they often situate her speech in
medieval time (the childhood or Combray of France). Proust
tells us that Fransoise is a true medieval peasant,
"survivant au xrxe siecle," whose soul incarnates the
medieval sculptural representations of saints and of "roischevaliers une fleur de lys .......
a la main n of the
quintessentially French church of Saint-Andr~-des-Champs at
Combray (DCS 178). Fransoise is similar to the medieval
artist who bu i 1 t the church of Sa int-Andr e-des-Champs
because of her antique oral tradition:
,j
On sentait que les notions que l'artiste medieval
et la paysanne medievale avaient de
l'histoire ancienne ou chretienne ••• , ils les
tenaient non des livres, mais d'une tradition a la
fois antique et directe, ininterrompue, orale,
d6form~e, meconnaissable et vivante. (DCS 179)
Even her cooking is spiced with the Middle Ages: the meals
which Fransoise prepares, from the local produce constantly
renewed at each season, take their inspiration from "ces
quatre-feuilles qu'on sculptait au XIIIe siecle au portail 
26
/ des cathedrales .•• " (DCS 88), and reflect the rhythm of
the seasons, of time and nature.
Without analyzing Fransoise's idiolect in relation to
his observation, Ramon Fernandez remarks that Fran5oise's
medievalism is shown through her purely oral speech, where
the errors take the force of a grammatical creation and her
proverbs the force of judgement; also by her active life,
her independent authority, and her submissiveness (186). I
would like to add that in Frangoise we find one of those
anonymous creators who maintain the nobility of the French
language by their innate peasant sense of conservation or
economy, while at the same time contributing to the richness
of the language by their genius for invention. In the
Parisian apartment to which Marcel's parents move, Fransoise
provides a particular decoration through her words
"inspirees d'un sentiment traditionnel et local et qui
obeissaient a des regles tres anciennes" (CG I 76).
Jean Mouton has observed that when she pronounces
"l'estoppeuse" for "la stoppeuse," Fransoise reminds us of
an old usage in the eleventh century, when certain initial
groups of consonants such as SC, SP, ST, SM were preceded by
an e-, initially derived from the latin i- (185). To
Proust, this feature of Fransoise's vocabulary is like those
curious animals, the whale and the giraffe, which show us
the states animal life have passed through: "n'etait-il pas
aussi curieux que ces animaux survivants des /
epoques 
27
lointaines comme la baleine ou la girafe, et qui nous
montrent les ~tats · que la vie anirnale a traverses?" (SG
158) •
Other errors resemble the medieval word-play of such
writers as Rabelais, when from the name "Antoine" she
produces "Antoinesse"; from "rnaire" "rnairesse" (CG I 27);
even from "Guillaume", referring to the German Emperor,
"Guillaurnesse" (TR 197). "[Elle] avait sans doute dans sa
cr~ation grarnrnaticale un inconscient ressouvenir de chanoine
et chanoinesse." Or, Proust suggests, this may be the
effect of ancient popular custom which consists in giving to
women the name of their husbands by adding a feminine
suffix, "par ce Frangais de jadis, dont Fran5oise etait la
- conternporaine" (CG I 27). From the nouns "routine" and
"alliance," she constructs the participles "routine" and
"allianc~" (DCS 132, CG I 25). Le Bidois points out that
verb forms, particularly past participles, are often
incorrect in her speech: Fransoise uses "conqu~ri" for
"conquis" (TR 192), "naquis" for ./ "ne" (AD 210, 211) • Some
words are formed by incorrect analogies: thus, from
"envahir" Fransoise creates "envahition," following the
pattern of other nouns formed on an infinitive stern with the
addition of the suffix -tion (TR 194). Words which have the
same meaning in some contexts, but which develop different
meanings in combination with a particular prefix or suffix,
are also misused, or at least reversed. "Figure" and 
28
"visage" have different meanings in such forms as
"defigurer" and "devisag~," which Fransoise interchanges.
She says of Saint-Loup, after his death at the front, "il
avait le nez coupe en deux, il etait tout d~visag~" (TR
201) •
Other deviations or errors are more typical of "le
fransais populaire" in general. Frangoise uses one popular
structure commonly employed in the formation of the
interrogative: "Comment done qu'on lui dit" (CG I 26). She
similarly confuses various forms of the relative pronoun:
"C'est lui qu'aurait pu m'en dire • n ( CG I 2 6) • The
possessive is expressed with "a" rather than "de," as
Fransoise, speaks of "une cousine au Due" (CG I 25). She
does not know the use of the partitive article, as one can
see from her commonly used structures like "avoir d'argent,"
"apporter d'eau" (CG I 24).
In his article "Proust linguiste" George Mator6 points
out that Fran5oise has an extensive vocabulary referring to
various parts of the social hierarchy, to which she is as
attached as any Guermantes (291). According to Fran5oise,
the Duchesse de Guermantes is "allianc~e" to all the
"gratin" of the Parisian society (CG I 25); people belonging
to high society who are, according to Frangoise, of the same
"parent~se" (DCS 182, CG I 25) have to see to it "ace qu'on
leur manque pas" (JFF 327). "Monde" means "demi-monde" in
Frangoise's social vision (JFF 74). The word "grand" is 
29
ambiguous in Frangoise's speech because it refers both to
the number of the members of a family and to the illustrious
name. The narrator explains that since the word "grand" has
multiple meanings, these meanings must form to her a single
unit, even as he describes her vocabulary in terms of
natural flaws in stone:
[N]'ayant que ce seul mot de "grand" pour les deux
choses, il lui semblait qu'elles n'en formaient
qu'une seule, son vocabulaire, comme certaines
pierres, pr~sentant ainsi par endroits un d~faut
qui projetait de l'obscurit~ jusque dans la pensee
de Fransoise. (CG I 26)
The most emphatic errors in syntax are Fransoise's lack of
agreement between the subject and the verb in, for example,
constructions with "c'est": "c'est ni plus ni moins des
fous" (DCS 108), "ce n'est pas des hommes" (DCS 108)~ and
the erroneous usage of the negation with "pas," as in "pour
pas qu'on se sauve" (DCS 109)~ and finally in the usage of
the demonstrative "sa" instead of "cela" and "ce," as in "sa
sera la fille a Mme Pupin" (DCS 71).
Other errors are due to the incorrect hearing of
certain words. Thus, Franc;oise pronounces "sectembre" for
"septembre" (CG I I 112). A combination of bad hearing and
ignorance of geography is responsible for Frangoise's
rendition of New York as "Nev' York" which she uses to refer
to either York or New York, unable to believe in the 
30
existence of the two distinct names, "trouvant d'une
prodigalit~ invraisemblable dans le vocabulaire qu'il pGt
exister ~ la fois York et New York" (JFF 26). Fransoise's
confusion extends especially to geographical names; she
recalls the existence in the Guermantes family of a "cousine
d'Alger," whereas in fact it is a matter of a "cousine
d'Angers." The narrator adds:
A Ce qui est lointain peut nous etre plus connu que
ce qui est proche. Fransoise, qui savait le nom
d'Alger a ' cause d'affreuses dattes que nous
recevions au jours de l'an, ignorait celui
d'Angers. Son langage, comme la langue fransaise
elle-m~me, et surtout sa toponymie, etait parsem~
d'erreurs. (CG I 26)
Thus Marcel begins to discern unique value in Fransoise's
language. As a child he heard only "fautes," despicable
deviations from standard French. As a young man and
apprentice writer, he begins to appreciate Fran_soise's
language for its "richesses," indeed beginning to hear it as
the essence of "la langue Fransaise elle-m@me." 
FRANSOISE'S WISDOM
In addition to such "erreurs," Fransoise's language is
rich in popular expressions that give to her speech a rural
flavor. Le Bidois does take into consideration a few of
these popular expressions in his article on the language of
Proust's characters, though he terms them "provincialismes"
(211). These expressions include: "Ici, tout se fait~ la
sauvette" (CG I 30); "J'ai encore ~ plumer mes asperges"
(DCS 74); "[la pommade lui] plumait le nez" (CG I 78);
"voleur comme une pie" (CG I 27); "pauvre jeunesse qui sera
/ / fauchee comme une pre" (DCS 108). She talks about an animal
"bien affable," and says "d'un garcon courageux" for
"travailleur." Marcel comments:
[C]ette appr~ciation aurait pu faire croire que
Fransoise avait chang~ d'avis sur la bravoure qui,
selon elle, a Combray, ravalait les hommes aux
animaux f€roces, mais il n'en ~tait rien.
Courageux signifiai t seulement travailleur. (CG I
26)
She observes, "l'envie de dormir lui coupe la figure" (SG
146), the narrator remarks, in this last case, "avec ce beau
fransais populaire et pourtant un peu individuel qui etait
le sien" (SG 146).
31 
32
Fran5oise's idiolect swarms also with the archaisms
which enliven her vocabulary and relate her language to that
of the most illustrious French classic writers. Thus, she
uses the verb "plaindre" in the same sense of La Bruyere,
and says, "[Elle] ne plaignait pas les perdreux, ni les
faisans" (CG I 30); "faire reponse, comme Mme de Sevigne'"
(CG I 26); "balancer" in the sense of "hesiter" like SaintSimon, "car elle usait, quand elle ne voulait pas rivaliser
avec les modernes, du langage mftme de Saint-Simon" (CG I
81); ' ; ~ and "a ses depens" for "a ses frais" because "(Cette
d~flexion n'avait rien de desobligeant pour nous, car
Fransoise ~tait d'un temps ou 'd~pens' n•e"tait pas reserve au
style judiciaire et signifiait seulement depense)" (CG I
3 0) •
By a provincial hereditary caginess, she has picked up
the habit of saying "peut-~tre" or "c'est possible" to what
is stated as a real and proved fact (CG I 361); saying "Je
ne sais pas" regarding facts that she has just come to know
(CG I 362); and prefacing her own incorrect statements with
"Le fait est ••• " Le Bidois notes that at times, when she
quotes the stories of other domestics, she uses indirect
speech, which allows her to address to her masters "les
pires injures avec impunite," because, as Marcel discerns,
the mitigating effect of indirection would be completely
nullified by the peremptory tone "de la plus indiscutable et
plus exasperante affirmation" (CG II 69, 212). 
33
Fransoise also possesses a "maniere insidieuse de poser
des questions d'une fason indirecte pour laquelle elle avait
utilise depuis quelque temps un certain 'parce que sans
doute'. N'osant pas me dire: 'Est-ce que cette dame a un
hStel?' elle me disait, les yeux timidement leves comme
ceux d'un bon chien: 'Parce que sans doute cette dame a son
hotel particulier ••• ', evitant l'interrogation flagrante
moins pour etre polie que pour ne pas sembler curieuse" (TR
7 8) •
It has not been noticed that in the literary context
the popular expressions in Fransoise's spoken French and the
local patois to which she resorts for secrets associate
Fransoise with "le Pays" in Proust's crucial distinction, in
the sections "Nom de Pays: le Nom" and "Nom de Pays: le
Pays," between real and falsely ideal. These popular
expressions help explain how Fransoise as peasant represents
the actuality of "le Pays" through her language, whereas the
youthful idealist Marcel represents the enchanted illusion
of "le Nom." In the section "le Nom" young Marcel weaves
images around the names of cities he desires to visit, and
he also dreams of certain persons who hold a particular
fascination for him such as the Guermantes. Marcel dreams
of Balbec, of the towns in Normandy through which the train
to Balbec passes, of the great art cities of Italy such as
Florence and Venice. After a while he is able to evoke at
will the charm of these places simply by pronouncing their 
34
names. But this evocation has its dangers. Although these
are means by which Marcel imagines an unknown reality, they
exclude much of the reality he will encounter. Verbal names
become for Marcel almost real places and real people.
Later, when he encounters the objects of these dreams, the
reality he imagined is indeed different from the image of
it. Just as he dreams of certain cities before encountering
them in reality, so he dreams of certain persons, such as
the Guermantes and La Berma. In both cases again, Marcel
finds no pleasure in what he sees and he is disappointed in
finding such a gap between the reality and the model that he
had created in his mind. To this date it has not been
observed that Fran3oise uses language in highly realisti c
and pragmatic way, whereas young Marcel uses language to
evoke ideal places and people. In so emphatically
contrasting the difference between "nom" and "pays," Proust
stresses his sharp differentiation between the idealist
concept of language as in the youthful Marcel, and the
realist use of language as in most especially Fransoise.
Thus, we can say that just as Marcel is identified with "le
Nom," Frangoise is identified with "le Pays."
We do not, however, know precisely where she comes
from, or what exactly is her "pays":
Ainsi son parler differait de celui de sa mere;
mais, ce qui est plus curieux, le parler de sa
m~re n'~tait pas le m~me que celu i de sa 
35
grand'm~re, native de Bailleau-le-Pi n, qui ~tait
si pr~s du pays de Fransoise. Pourtant les patois
differaient leg~rement comme les deux paysages.
Le pays de la m~re de Fransoise, en pente et
d d ..... , . f.,. " 1 escen ant a un rav~n, eta~t requente par es
saules. Et tres loin de la, au contraire, il y
avait en France une petite region ou on parlait
presque tout ~ fait le m~me patois qu'a Meseglise.
(SG 148)
Proust is being deliberately vague here, for in most cases
we know precisely the "pays" for each character (Odette
comes from Marseille, for example). There are symbolic
reasons for this overt refusal to specify Fransoise's
region. Unlike that of most peasant characters in fiction,
Fransoise's language does not exhibit any regionalisms
because Fransoise is France. Meseglise, Combray, and
Tansonville are old friends to Fran5oise, for if she has any
"pays" it is this one, the Combray region (source of all
Marcel's experience and later art) which she has adopted as
her own:
Son plaisir venait aussi de sentir que ces pays-la
etaient pour elle quelque chose qu'ils n'~taient
pas pour les autres, de vieux camarades avec qui
on a fait bien des parties; et elle leur souriait
comme si elle leur trouvait de l'esprit, parce
qu'elle retrouvait en eux beaucoup d'elle-m~me. 
36
(CG I 2 9)
Her popular expressions indeed show that she has been
in actual and close contact with her adopted region and that
she is an integral part of it. (We must remember that
Combray is a fictional village with therefore no literally
regional speech or patois, enabling Proust thus to use
Frangoise's language symbolically.) When in Paris Fransoise
fondly evokes her "r~gion," it is her adopted Combray where
she used to live: "Ah! Combray, quand est-ce que je te
reverrai, pauvre terre!" (CG I 20), and not at all an
idealized place. So she therefore does not have to suffer,
like Marcel, the gap separating the abstract "name"
belonging to a world of absolutes from the concrete
experience in direct sensation remembered.
Frangoise is conscious of the poverty of her language
when she says, "Je ne sais pas m'exprimer" (DCS 182). In
another instance, when she feels great grief at the
knowledge that the grandmother is going to die, Marcel says
of her:
[E]lle ne possedait pas l'art si simple, de
1 'expr imer / /
• Et elle ne savait que repeter:
'Cela me fait quelque chose', du meme ton dont
elle disait, quand elle avait pris trop de soupe
aux choux: 'J'ai comme un poids sur l'estomac.'
(CG II 43)
But her expressive insufficiencies are compensated by the 
37
rich popular expressions and by the number and variety of
proverbs she employs, proverbs which in many situations have
the advantage of being an indirect yet unequivocal allusion
to a particular subject. An old Combray proverb becomes
Fransoise's comment on Albertine's indiscretion in accepting
hospitality without reciprocating, as she chants "Mangeons
mon pain/-Je le veux bien/-Mangeons le tien/-Je n'ai plus
faim" (SG 159). Another much more earthy proverb is
translated by Fransoise from her mother's patois to express
her disgust with the illicit pregnancy of the "fille de
cuisine" and her incredulity that any man could be attracted
to her, "Qui du cul d'un chien s'amourose,/Il lui paratt une
rose" (DCS 147). She remarks, "la premi~re fois qu'on le
voit on lui donnerait le bon Dieu sans confession, mais il y
a des jours oli il est poli comme une porte de prison." (SG
218) She pontificates, "la vie, le seul cadeau que le bon
Dieu ne fasse jamais deux fois" (DCS 108). In addition to
the sense of medieval judgement that is inherent in these
proverbs, I should like to add that they encapsulate the
wisdom and essence of popular experience in spoken French,
as Marcel himself later discovers he must do as an artist
for all experience through literary metaphor. Just as
Fransoise is unable to express the essence of her opinions
other than through proverbs, Marcel learns that he can
express the essence of his experience only in metaphors in,
not popular, but high literary art. 
38
In spite of such expressive limitations in language,
Frangoise manages to communicate all that she wants Marcel
to know, notably her feelings, sometimes even without speech
or gesture. Her non-verbal expressiveness goes so far as to
make the narrator compare her with a great tragedian:
Mais levant alors les yeux sur Fransoise •.• , je
m'apersus, avec admiration et fureur, que, capable
de rivaliser avec la Berma elle-m~me dans l'art de
faire parler les v~tements inanimes et les traits
du visage, Fransoise avait su faire la leson ~ son
... corsage, a ses cheveux dont les plus blancs
avaient ete ramen{s a la surface, exhibes comme un
extrait de naissance, ' ; a son cou courbe par la
fatigue et l'obeissance. Ils la plaignaient
. / / ~ d'avol.r ete tiree du sommeil et de la moiteur du
lit, au milieu de la nuit, ~ son ~ge •.• (SG
156)
Here at mid-point in the novel, Marcel comes to regret
his mockery of Fransoise's defective language. He admits
that, in spite of its frequent deviations from standard
French usage, her language nevertheless embodies "le genie
linguistique ~ / l'etat vivant, l'avenir I et le passe du
frangais" (SG 158). In the last part of the novel,
Fran comes into her most positive and adult
relationship with the hero and assumes her most significant
role in the narrative, which here reaches its climax in the 
39
realization of the hero's vocation as artist. We have seen
how the idiolect of the Guermantes, the Verdurins, and the
Norpois of the Proustian world manifest a superficial
fagade. In Le Temps retrouye at the matin~e Guermantes, the
ostensible aristocratic elegance suddenly crumbles before
Marcel, revealing hideous banality: "[J] 'avais vu les
nobles devenir vulgaires ••. ," (TR 281) and even their
banal idiolects remain so under their all their finery.
The only person who remains .by the narrator's side to
the end is the faithful old servant Fransoise. If A la
Recherche du temps perdu is the story of its own creation,
then Fransoise is the living muse of this creation. At the
end of Marcel's life, at the moment when he will be detached
from the contingencies of the world and of love to dedicate
himself to art, Marcel, who will become the narrator,
enriched by his experience, finally renders justice to his
old servant. He understands that her intuition and her
power of comprehension are like natural gifts which allow
her, as ignorant as she may be, to participate in the
creation of Marcel's last and only precious possession, his
art:
[J]e pensais que sur rna grande table de bois
blanc, regarde par Fran5oise, comme tous les ~tres
/ t . . . ' 1\ / d t sans preten 1on qu1 v1vent a cote e nous on une
certaine intuition de nos t~ches, je travaillerais
aupr~s d'elle, et presque comme elle •.• (TR 
40
424)
In terms of language in literary art, here lies one of the
capital points of the whole Recherche. Just as previously
we saw young Marcel gradually going beyond standard French
in his quest for a robust language with a genuine flavor of
the soil and lived experience, where even the discrepancies
attest to its vitality and historical past, fundamentally
independent moreover of social class and of education, now
he exults at finding this essential French in Fransoise's .
speech, "Ce n'est pas dans les froids pastiches des
~crivains d'aujourd'hui qu'on retrouve le vieux langage et
la vraie prononciation des mots, mais en causant avec •
Fransoise" (LP 38).
Now at the end of the novel, more than ever before,
strong ties bind the artist and the peasant and they find
each other in supreme harmony. His only literary helper
will be Fransoise, for partly because of her instinctive
understanding of literary work she knows more than
intelligent or ordinary people:
[A] force de vivre de rna vie, elle s'~tait fait du
travail litt~raire une sorte de "h . compre ens1on
instinctive, plus juste que celle de bien des gens
intelligents, ~plus forte raison que celle des
gens b~tes. (TR 425)
But more importantly she is the only one who understands
that literary work is "travail" and "labeur": "Frangoise 
41
devinait mon bonheur et respectait mon travail" (TR 425).
It needs tools, and it needs materials. And she understands
perfectly that just as she needs buttons and thread in order
to sew, Marcel needs his "paperoles" to be able to write:
[C]ar, tpinglant un feuillet suppl~mentaire, je
b~tirais mon livre, je n'ose pas dire
ambitieusement comme une cath~drale, mais tout
simplement comme une robe. Quand je n'aurais pas
aupr~s de moi toutes mes paperoles, comme disait
Frangoise, et que me manquerait juste celle dont
j 'aurais besoin, Franc:,oise comprendrait bien mon
enervement, "" elle qui disait toujours qu'elle ne
pouvait pas coudre si elle n'avait pas le num~ro
de fil et les boutons qu'il fallait. (TR 424)
And here is where the artist meets the peasant: his kind of
artistic writing is like peasant labor, for they are both
artisans. A sort of mutual identification begins between
the two workers because Fransoise also has an intuitive
appreciation of the satisfaction that Marcel recieves from
his work, as she from hers:
D'ailleurs, comme les individualit~s (humaines ou
non) sont dans un livre faites d'impressions
nombreuses qui, prises de bien des jeunes filles,
de bien des ~glises, de bien des senates, servent
a faire une seule senate, une seule ~glise, une
seule jeune fille, ne ferais-je pas mon livre de 
42
la fason que Fransoise faisait ce boeuf mode,
/ . / d . apprec1e par M. e Norpo1s, et dont tant de
morceaux de viande ajout~s et choisis
enrichissaient la gelte? (TR 426)
At the end of La Recherche, when the whole social
pyramid of the Proustian world collapses, all we have left
is Time, interpreted as basic, peasant moral goodness and
art. And Marcel discovers that to construct his own
modernist "cathedral" in verbal art, metaphoric palimpsest
of French character and history, his only companion will be
Fransoise, sole "genie linguistique ~ l'~tat vivant."

"the linguistic system of one person, differing in some
detail from all other speakers of the same dialect or
language" (239); The Glossary of Linguistic Terminology as
"the individual's use of language, with his own speech
habits and choice of words; the speech habit of a single
person at a given point in his lifetime" (119).

The Imagery of Proust (New York and London: Barnes & Noble,
1966) so.
5 One must nevertheless consider the possibility that
Fransoise was modelled upon one of Proust's real maids, such
as the now famous C~leste Albaret who published her own
autobiography in 1973; and consequently that her idiolect
was modelled upon the real speech of a living person.
However as soon as one endeavors to determine connections
between Proust's fictive character and the real persons he
had known, one runs into complex problems. Every character
turns out to be a montage of historical models. To begin
with, C~leste Albaret was not the only maid in Proust's
service, so if he did in fact t~ke a model for the creation
of Fransoise from among the maids, which one would- he have
taken C~line, Ernestine Gallou, F~licie Fitau or Celeste
Albaret? And why not all of them, as George D. Painter
proposes "[Ernestine Gallou] 'tait la premiere d'une longue
suite de domestiques qui furent fondus ensemble dans le
personnage de Fransoise n (1:51). Much more
importantly, Proust himself protested that there were no
keys to either his characters or his novel as a whole,
insisting that it is not a "roman a clefs": "Dans ce livre
o~ il n'y a pas un seul fait qui ne soit pas fictif, ou il
' .... / / n'y a pas un seul personnage 'a clefs', ou tout a ete
invente par moi selon les besoins de rna demonstration • "
(TR 197) 
45
There are, however, some transparent similarities
between certain of Proust's maids and Frangoise. Ernestine
Gallou, officially Marcel's aunt Elisabeth's governess, for
example, has in common with Frangoise complete devotion
toward her mistress and cruelty toward her subordinates,
notably toward "la fille de cuisine"; moreover Painter says
of her:
Le parler d'Ernestine ~tait plein de mots anciens
et de phrases qu'il retrouvera plus tard chez
Moli~re ou Saint-Simon; son visage avait les
traits de noblesse et de courage, de cr€dulit~ et
de ruse qu'il reconnaissait dans les sculptures de
Chartres ou du porche imaginaire de Saint-Andr e'-
des-Champs, pres de Combray. Elle devint pour lui
le symbole d'une France d'autrefois, avec une
/ / 1 . genea og~e aussi ancienne que celle d'un
Guermantes. (Painter 1: 51)
On the other hand, the name of F~licie Fitau, an old family
servant always wearing "un bonnet blanc," was jotted down in
a set of Proust's notes in conjunction with Frangoise, as
was the name of a certain Marie, and another old servant at
Illiers (Barker 237). C~line, another maid, was also
similar to Fransoise in her hostility toward Proust's friend
Agostinelli, just as Frangoise hates Albertine in the novel,
and in fact when Proust and his maid Celine argued on this
point, Celine was replaced by C~leste (Painter 2:272). 
46
/ /
Celine called Celeste "l'enjoleuse," the same term used by
Frangoise referring to the ostensibly fictive "Marie
Gineste" and "C~leste Albaret" in their brief appearances in
La Recherche (SG 283). The upright and intelligent Celeste
was in the service of Proust by late October or early
November of 1913, and maybe even before that since it was
she who in February 1912 wrapped a package containing the
manuscript of Du COte de chez Slim to send to one of the
publishers (Rivers 264): note that this completed first
volume already contained the most complete delineation of
the character Fransoise. C~leste had lived in Auxillac, her
native "pays," before she came to work for Proust, and they
became united by a deep tie. Proust had been struck by h er
speech, in which he seemed to hear the poetry of the
peasant, rich in the imagery of nature (Rivers 232). Proust
made C~leste almost as much a confidant and companion as a
servant, so that after a year in the house, she occupied
somewhat the same place in his life that his mother had
occupied a decade before (Barker 232). He liked C~leste
because she introduced him to another world; when she
entered his room, he seemed to see the millhouse at Auxillac
where she had grown up, the convent at La Canourgue where
she had spent a year with the nuns, the plateaus and the
gorges and the torrents of her native Auvergne (Barker 233).
Her moods persistently reminded him of water, and this facet
/ of her speech is also shared by the "Celeste" in the novel: 
Mlle Marie Gineste et Mme Ce'leste Albaret.
47
; Nees

France, au bord de ruisseaux et de torrents, elles
semblaient en avoir garde la nature ••• C~leste

lac, mais avec de terribles retours de
-. bouillonnement ou sa fureur rappelait le danger
des crues et des tourbillons liquides qui
h entrarnent tout, saccagent tout. (SG 280)
Celeste also reminds us of the Fransoise of the late
volumes because Proust took her into his confidence,
described his novel to her, showed her scenes from his
manuscript, and made her feel that she had a share in his
work. Often when he needed information, he would send
Celeste "' out to get it. Proust also recorded his impressions
on sheets of paper, which ce'leste would afterwards paste
into the notebooks, but there is no indication that ce'leste
referred to them as "paperoles." Finally ce'leste, like
Frangoise became an important collaborator for Proust at the
end of his life; he dictated to her what have been described
as supplementary notes on the death of Bergotte, and he
asked her to see that they were inserted into their proper
place, as Fransoise does in La Recherche (Barker 353-4).
Nevertheless, I would like to make clear that since one
cannot pinpoint any single model from which Proust created
either his fictive Frangoise or her language, and since 
48
Proust's characterological principle of montage is familiar
from other characters such as Albertine, one must not equate
Celeste's idiolect with that of Fransoise. Proust could
have had in mind the speech of all his maids or none at all,
but probably several. Two things are certain. First,
Proust creates a fictive C~leste Albaret who possesses
/ certain linguistic characteristics of the real Celeste.
Second, and perhaps most conclusively Proust had already
" , completed Du Cote de chez Swann or the fullest portrayal of
Fransoise and her language before meeting Celeste Albaret.
